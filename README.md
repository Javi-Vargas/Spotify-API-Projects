# Spotify-API-Projects
Learning and using the Spotify to create apps that perform tasks on behalf of your spotify account.
Goal is to host these apps and have theses tasks automated.

A very important instruction when using the Spotify Dev version and creating the app. Keep your 'client_id' and 'client_secret' for the app in .env file and call it that way.
Separate from the running code. No one should be able to see or have access to those values, do not hardcode them in.
